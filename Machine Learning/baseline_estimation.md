## Introduction

ACNielsen and Information Resources (IRI) are leading market research firms that collect and track data on various CPG products. This data includes product attributes and detailed information on consumer purchasing behavior. This information allows manufacturers and retailers to develop highly detailed models to measure the effectiveness of promotions and other marketing tactics like advertising, price changes, and public relations [1]. 

A key element of all these models is establishing a baseline sales level. This represents the expected sales in the absence of a specific marketing tactic, like a price promotion. By comparing actual sales to this baseline, marketers can determine the effectiveness of their campaigns. Baseline sales are simply the counterfactual of sales activity in the hypothetical case of no promotions for a period of time [1].
